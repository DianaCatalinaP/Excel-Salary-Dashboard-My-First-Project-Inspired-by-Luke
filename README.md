# Excel-Salary-Dashboard-My-First-Project-Inspired-by-Luke
This is my first Excel dashboard project, and it was inspired by Luke’s example. I followed his work closely as a learning guide. This project helped me understand how to work with real data—especially job salaries and roles in the data field—and practice key Excel skills like charts, formulas, and data validation.
